  ## Description
PortfolioFusion is a comprehensive portfolio consisting of four pages, built using React. It serves as a professional platform to showcase the developer's skills, projects, and contact information. The portfolio is organized into four main sections: 'About Me', 'Portfolio', 'Contact', and 'Resume'.

The 'About Me' section provides a concise biography and a photograph of the developer. In the 'Portfolio' section, you can find images and descriptions of the developer's applications, along with links to both the deployed applications and their corresponding GitHub repositories.

For easy communication, the 'Contact' section includes a convenient form. And finally, the 'Resume' section contains a link to download the developer's resume and a list of their areas of expertise.
